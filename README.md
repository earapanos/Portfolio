This dashboard is a continuation of my <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/RealStateDataAnalysis">Data Analytics and Science project.</a> I developed this work independently and was responsible for creating the screens, selecting the KPIs, and establishing metrics for analyzing the square meter value in the central region of Florianópolis.

The dashboard was designed to be an interactive tool that enables real estate developers to understand the spatial distribution of the square meter value in downtown Florianópolis. It can also serve as a query tool for individuals looking to acquire property, providing access to information that facilitates the selection of a residential location.

<h3>Data source</h3>
The Real State Data used were providen by <a href="https://locates.com.br/"> LOCATES technology company.</a> LOCATES main objective is **simplify and potentialize the  property development working with geographic intelligence, big data and artificial intelligence.**

For use the Real State Data were previously developed some steps of exporting, analysis, cleaning and transformation of the data. 

All those processes could be viewed at:

Hello! This code was developed by me using the python object oriented principles.

The objective of this code is turn easy the access and download data from database. This is an important step of Data Alytics because in this step we can filter and select a specific range of data relationed with a temporal time, or a type of information.

<a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/tree/main/access_db">Here you can access the code.</a>Here you can access the code. I subdvided the code in three parts:

1. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/main.py">The first</a> part is the main archive, which information about the host, user, password, database and gateway are insert.
2. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/conectar_db.py">The second</a> archive which connect with the database.
3. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/download_tabela.py">The third</a> archive witch download and save the data in the machine.

I projected this code in a way to turn easy to change and addapting like the necessity of daily work.

In the routine of Data Analyst, it's very common the processes which deal with tables. Pivoting table is a process which consists in transform *columns into lines and vice versa.*

This process is very important to:

* group items/records/rows into categories;
* count the number of items in each category;
* sum the items value;
* or compute average, find minimal or maximal value etc.

<a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Pandas-PivotingTable/blob/main/pivoting-table.ipynb">Here in this code</a>, I used Pandas library to pivot a table. The objective of it was transform columns in lines <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Pandas-PivotingTable/blob/main/tabela/zon_usos2_202311301557.csv">in this table</a> and realation it with a spatial table on database to create indicators of a specific types of buildins which are allowed do build in the determinated areas.
