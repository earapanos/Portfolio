Today I will propose many insights about the Florianópolis Downtown Real State Data. 

The data was provided by the LOCATES technologic company, that I work nowadays, with the purpose of I apply the knowledge of the Data Science Course, that I've been doing.

For maintain the value of the products of the LOCATES co., I selected old adverts from the first semester of 2022.

We will explore the Real State Data from the Downtown neighborhood of Florianópolis City, Brazil. The data were collected from internet adverts that is, they are real ads. We are interested in the propoerties which are saling, to indentify the **spatial distribution of the apartament meter square of these properties on the neighbohood** and compare secondarily it if a role data, including data without coordinates.

This processes were developed in this project:

1. Download the data from LOCATES co. database;
2. Importing the data set to Kaggle;
3. Data structure and content analysis;
4. Data cleaning;
5. Data visualization: analysis between de data with values to lat/lon columns and data with NaN values to these columns;
6. Data visualization: a Square Meter Apartament Value Map from Downtown of Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil;
7. Final Considerations.

Hello! This code was developed by me using the python object oriented principles.

The objective of this code is turn easy the access and download data from database. This is an important step of Data Alytics because in this step we can filter and select a specific range of data relationed with a temporal time, or a type of information.

<a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/tree/main/access_db">Here you can access the code.</a>Here you can access the code. I subdvided the code in three parts:

1. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/main.py">The first</a> part is the main archive, which information about the host, user, password, database and gateway are insert.
2. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/conectar_db.py">The second</a> archive which connect with the database.
3. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/download_tabela.py">The third</a> archive witch download and save the data in the machine.

I projected this code in a way to turn easy to change and addapting like the necessity of daily work.

In the routine of Data Analyst, it's very common the processes which deal with tables. Pivoting table is a process which consists in transform *columns into lines and vice versa.*

This process is very important to:

* group items/records/rows into categories;
* count the number of items in each category;
* sum the items value;
* or compute average, find minimal or maximal value etc.

<a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Pandas-PivotingTable/blob/main/pivoting-table.ipynb">Here in this code</a>, I used Pandas library to pivot a table. The objective of it was transform columns in lines <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Pandas-PivotingTable/blob/main/tabela/zon_usos2_202311301557.csv">in this table</a> and realation it with a spatial table on database to create indicators of a specific types of buildins which are allowed do build in the determinated areas.
