<h1 align="center"> üêç Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB </h1>

Hello! This code was developed by me using the python object oriented principles.

The objective of this code is turn easy the access and download data from database. This is an important step of Data Alytics because in this step we can filter and select a specific range of data relationed with a temporal time, or a type of information.

<a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/tree/main/access_db">Here you can access the code.</a>Here you can access the code. I subdvided the code in three parts:

1. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/main.py">The first</a> part is the main archive, which information about the host, user, password, database and gateway are insert.
2. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/conectar_db.py">The second</a> archive which connect with the database.
3. <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Python-AccessAndDownloadDataDB/blob/main/access_db/download_tabela.py">The third</a> archive witch download and save the data in the machine.

I projected this code in a way to turn easy to change and addapting like the necessity of daily work.

If you like the code and you've suggestions, please, talk with me.

In the routine of Data Analyst, it's very common the processes which deal with tables. Pivoting table is a process which consists in transform *columns into lines and vice versa.*

This process is very important to:

* group items/records/rows into categories;
* count the number of items in each category;
* sum the items value;
* or compute average, find minimal or maximal value etc.

<a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Pandas-PivotingTable/blob/main/pivoting-table.ipynb">Here in this code</a>, I used Pandas library to pivot a table. The objective of it was transform columns in lines <a href="https://github.com/earapanos/Pandas-PivotingTable/blob/main/tabela/zon_usos2_202311301557.csv">in this table</a> and realation it with a spatial table on database to create indicators of a specific types of buildins which are allowed do build in the determinated areas.
